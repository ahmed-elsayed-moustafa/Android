This is the android app my team and i created in University. It was an APP designed to take information displayed on worldbank about countries and create an application which would focus on a certain topic and educate the user about this in respect to the countrie selected.

My team chose to select the topic of Education.

So the user of this App can simply select the countries of their choice and a topic and then view the graphs to visually represent the statistics with respect to Education between these countries.

My team and i decided to use multiple types of graphs to enhance the experience.
